## Introduction

- Power of LLM (Large Language Model) as a developer to that is using API calls to LLM to quickly build software applications.

What I will learn
- Prompting best practices for software development
- Common use cases, summarizing, inferring, transforming, expanding
- Build chatbot using an LLM

## Two types of LLMs
- Base LLM
  - Predicts next word, based on text training data
  - ex) "What is capital of France?"
    - "What is France's largest City?" <- Series of questions from quizes in internet
- Instruction Tuned LLM
  - Tries to follow instructions and good attempts at following those instructions.
  - ex) "What is capital of France?"
    - "Capital of France is Paris."
  - RLHF: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
  - Helpful, Honest, Harmless
  
Recommend focus on instruction tuned LLMs <- easier to use, becomeing safer and more aligned.
